- Used when we **don’t know the true standard deviation** in the population

- We can use the estimated standard error, $s_{\bar{x}}$, in place of the true standard error, $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$

# Review: one sample _t_-test

As the name implies, we have **_one_ sample** to compare to the population mean under the null hypothesis, $H_{0}$. For example:

--

_Does lie detection accuracy differ significantly from chance?_

--

- We collect $n = 40$ students, they watch videos of liars and truth-tellers, and we compute their accuracy performance as $\bar{x} = 0.56$ and $s = 0.12$

--

  - The null hypothesis is $H_{0}: \mu = 0.50$ which would represent chance performance
  
  - The alternative hypothesis is $H_{a}: \mu \neq 0.50$

--

.center[

One sample _t_-test: $t_{\overline{x}} = \frac{0.56 - 0.50}{\frac{0.12}{\sqrt{40}}} = \frac{0.06}{.01897367} = 3.16$

$p = .0003 < \alpha$ so we reject the null hypothesis

Three types we'll learn:

- One sample _t_-test

- Independent samples _t_-test

- **Dependent samples _t_-test**


---

class: center, middle, inverse

# Dependent samples _t_-test

---

# Independent vs. Dependent

- **Independent-samples** (called _between-subjects_) compare two _different_ or unrelated groups of people


- **Dependent-samples** (called _within-subjects_) compare the _same_ group of people to themselves

--

Put another way: 

- A _t_-test for independent means indicates that two groups of different participants are being studied under two separate conditions

--

- A _t_-test for dependent means indicates that a single group of the same participants is being studied under two conditions

---

# Goal: Dependent samples _t_-test

- To investigate whether some treatment made an effect compared to a baseline within the same individual(s)

--

- The dependent-samples _t_-test asks whether the mean difference between each subject’s pair of observed values is significantly different from 0

--

Put another way:

- Did _pre-treatment_ scores differ from _post-treatment_ scores?

# Example Experiment


**Self-Efficacy Scale**

_"Please rate the following on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 14 (strongly agree)"_

1. If I can’t do a job the first time, I keep trying until I can.

2. When I have something unpleasant to do, I stick to it until I finish it.

3. Failure just makes me try harder.

4. I am a self-reliant person.
