# Key Concepts for the Final Exam

# Key Concepts

- Identifying when to use a particular test statistic

  - One sample, independent, or dependent _t_-test
  
  - One-way ANOVA or Simple linear regression

--

- Identifying design types (within-subjects, between-subjects)

--

- Difference between factors and levels

--
  
- Main effects vs. interaction

--

- Why ANOVA instead of many _t_-tests?

--

- Effect size benchmarks

???

Cohen's d
- A small effect size ranges from 0 to .2.
- A medium effect size ranges from .2 to .8.
- A large effect size is any value above .8.

Correlation

0 to .1 Weak or no relationship
.2 Weak to moderate relationship
.3 Moderate relationship
.4 Moderate to strong relationship
.5 to 1.0 Strong relationship

Eta-squared

- A small effect size is about .01.
- A medium effect size is about .06.
- A large effect size is about .14.

.pull-right[
**When to use it**

- When you only have one sample of participants

- You are comparing a _sample_ mean to a population mean or a chance value

.secondary[Example 1]: You want to know if a sample of DU students' math performance is higher than the national average (i.e., a population mean)

.secondary[Example 2]: You want to determine whether  a sample's lie detection peformance is above chance, (i.e., 50%) 
]

---

# One sample design

- We know the population mean but not the standard deviation or variance

- We can estimate it with the sample statistics using a one-sample t-test

.pull-right[
**When to use it**

- You have two independent samples of participants

- .secondary[Example 2]: You are comparing two groups not randomly assigned (e.g., DU students vs. CU students)
]

# Independent samples

- This is also referred to as a **between-subjects** design. 

- Why? Because we are comparing the means _between_ two groups

.secondary[Exampl 2]: We measure anxiety before a treatment, administer a treatment, and measure anxiety post-treatment
]

# Dependent samples

- This is also referred to as a **within-subjects** design. 

- Why? Because we are comparing two means _within_ groups

# Practice Examples

**Which type of statistical test?**  

A researcher is investigating whether the prevalence of drug use on their campus differs from the national prevalence of universities and colleges. 

--

_One-sample t-test_

--

**What type of design?**  

A researcher wants to know whether a new memory supplement enhances recall. Participants are given an initial memory test. Then, they are given the new supplement and wait for it to take effect by doing a neutral task. Then, the research gives them a final memory test.

--

_Within-subjects_

---

# Practice Examples

**Which type of design and statistical test**?

A researcher wants to know if people will have better job interview performance if they watch funny videos to calm their nerves before the interview. Participants are randomly assigned to watch either funny videos or neutral videos about waves, birds, and clouds. Participants then do a mock interview. The interviewer rates how likely they would be to hire them.

_Between-subjects_, _Independent samples t-test_

A researcher is studying DU students. Specifically, the difference in 1 mile running time among DU athletes, DU students who go to the gym regularly, and DU students who are not athletes or go to the gym regularly. Here, _"DU athletes"_ is a:

--

_Level_

--

How many levels are in this factor?

--

_Three levels_:

- DU athletes

- DU students who go to the gym regularly

- DU students who are not athletes or go to the gym regularly

# Practice Examples

The same researcher does a follow-up study with DU students. Specifically, the researcher is studying difference in 1 mile running time among DU athletes, DU students who go to the gym regularly, and DU students who are not athletes or go to the gym regularly. The researcher also asks students whether they participated in sports during high school (yes, no) to see if prior experience affects the results. Here, _"participated in sports during high school"_ is a:

# Main effects and interactions

.content-box-gray[
**Main effect**: When an analysis of the data reveals a difference between the levels of any factor

**Interaction**: describes the degree to which the effect of _one factor_ depends on the _level_ of the other factor

# ANOVA vs. Regression

**ANOVA**

- In ANOVA the factors (or independent variables) _must be_ nominal or ordinal (i.e., categorical)

- In ANOVA, we are comparing mean differences

--

**Regression** 

- In Regression the predictors (or independent variables) _can be_ interval or ratio (i.e., continuous)

- In regression, we are making predictions
