# Hypothesis

**Hypothesis**: a specific, clear, and testable proposition or predictive statement about the possible outcome of a scientific research study

When we use _samples_ to approximate _populations_, however, we always have **sampling error** (difference between the sample statistic and the population parameter)

# Statistical Significance

.content-box-gray[

**Statistical Significance**: A result is said to be _significant_, or _statistically significant_, if it is very unlikely to occur when the null hypothesis is true. That is, the result is sufficient to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, a treatment has a significant effect if the decision from the hypothesis test is to reject $H_{0}$

**Truth**

.pull-left[
There is no effect, $H_{0}$

There is an effect, $H_{1}$

Because these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, one of these has to be true and only one of them can be true

--

But _sampling error_ is always acting, so occasionally we’ll get samples that are different from the truth in the world, which will lead to erroneous conclusions

---

# Influences of Type I Errors

- A Type I error occurs when we reject $H_{0}$ even though $H_{0}$ is true

--

- In other words, we found something in the critical region and called it "extreme enough" to be a real effect, when in reality, it wasn't

--

- Recall that boundaries of the critical region are determined by alpha, which is under our control

---

# Critical Regions

The locations of the critical region boundaries for three different levels of significance: $\alpha = .05$, $\alpha = .01$, $\alpha = .001$

.center[

<img src="img/critical-regions-at-different-alphas.png" width="65%"/>
]

.footnote[

]

---

# Probability of a Type I Error

So, Type I error rates are under our control and their probability is simply equal to alpha (assuming that the true state of the world is that $H_{0}$ is true)

--

If $H_{1}$ is true, what proportion of the time could we have a false positive?

--

.center[
$p(Type \: I \: error \: | \: H_{1} \:is \: True) = 0$

]

--

.center[

$p(Type \: I \: error \: | \: H_{0} \:is \: True) = \alpha$

]

--

In other words: 

- If $H_{1}$ is true, there is no risk of a Type I error

- If $H_{0}$ is true, the risk of a Type I error is $\alpha$

---

# Probability of a Type I Error

.center[

<img src="img/decision-table-1.png" width="80%"/>
]

---

# Probability of a Type II Error

.center[

$p(Type \: II \: error \: | \: H_{1} \:is \: True) = \beta$

$p(Type \: II \: error \: | \: H_{0} \:is \: True) = 0$

]

--

In other words: 

- If $H_{1}$ is true, the risk of a Type II error is $\beta$

- If $H_{0}$ is true, there is no risk of a Type II error

# Probability of Specificity

.content-box-gray[

# Alpha and Beta

**Alpha**: probability of a false positive (Type I error)

**Beta**: probability of a false negative (Type II error)

--

- We know alpha ahead of time and it is under our control, but what about beta?

--

- We often don't know what it is equal to ahead of time, but beta comes from statistical power, $1-\beta$, which we will discuss next

# Statistical Power

.content-box-gray[
**Statistical power**: the probability that the test will correctly reject a false null hypothesis. That is, power is the probability that the test will identify an effect if one really exists

**Cohen's _d_ for one-sample _z_-test**

.Large[
$$d_{z} = \frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{\sigma}$$

The size of an effect here would be how large our numerator is

$\overline{x}$ estimates the mean under $H_{1}$

$\mu$ is the mean under $H_{0}$

$\sigma$ is the standard deviation under $H_{0}$

# Influences of Statistical Power
