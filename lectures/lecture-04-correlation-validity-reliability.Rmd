# Defining Relationships in the World

---

# Correlations

.content-box-gray[
In psychological science, **correlational designs** examine the extent to which two variables are associated
]

--

_Examples_

- Do people who are more creative do better in school?

- Is there a relationship between hours studied and exam scores? Class attendance and final grades?

- Are people who have higher marital satisfaction better parents?


---

# Correlations

Correlations are either _positive_, _negative_, or _zero_

# Correlations

```{r xaringan-editable-1, echo=FALSE}

.pull-left[
**Positive correlation**: as one variable changes, the other variable changes in the .primary[_same direction_]

_Examples_

- Relationship between hours studied and exam grade

  - More hours studied, better exam grade
  
  - Fewer hours studied, worse exam grade

# Correlations

.pull-left[
 Correlations are _always_ between -1.0 and +1.0

    - Correlations closer to absolute value of 1 are _stronger_
  
    - Correlations closer to a value of 0 are _weaker_

Correlations do not imply causation, and leave three possibilities for how causation might occur. If we find that there is a positive correlation between ice cream sales and shark attacks, it could be that ice cream causes shark attacks

# Reliability and Validity

## A few preliminaries

---

# Terminology

.content-box-gray[
**Independent variable**: The variable that is hypothesized to have an effect on some outcome of interest

]

--

.content-box-gray[
**Dependent variable**: The outcome of interest that the independent variable might have an effect on
]

--

| | Hypothesized to influence | Hypothesized to be influenced |
|--- | :---: | :---: |
|Experiment | Independent variable | Dependent variable |
| Correlational study | Predictor variable | Outcome variable |

---

# Terminology

.content-box-gray[
**Reliability**: Does it work accurately every time?
]

.content-box-gray[
**Validity**: Is it actually measuring what it was designed to measure?
]

--

Why does this matter?

Since we're heading toward .primary[_inferential statistics_], it's very important that our data are what we think they are

You'll learn more about this topic in Research Methods

---

# Validity & Reliability: Example

.pull-left[
- Are manipulations and measures reliable and valid?

- **Valid**: measuring/manipulating what you intend to
measure?

- **Reliable**: consistency of measurement/manipulation?

]

.pull-right[

# Classical Test Theory

.content-box-gray[
**True score**: The true value that we are trying to measure
]

--

You understand 95% of the concepts and computations

In an ideal world, you would receive a 95% on the midterm

--

.content-box-gray[
**Observed Score**: The value that we actually measure
]

You receive a 78% on the midterm

# Reliability

---

# Reliability

- **Test-Retest Reliability**: Used to determine whether a test (or scale) is reliable over time 

--

- **Parallel Forms Reliability**: Used to examine the equivalence or similarity between two forms of the same test (or scale)

--

- **Internal consistency**: Used to determine whether the items on a test (or scale) are consistent with each other

---

# Test-Retest Reliability

.content-box-gray[
**Test-Retest Reliability**: Measured as the correlation $r_{xy}$ between scores on a measure at Time 1 and the same measure at Time 2
]

--

- Example: Developing a new personality measure

.center[
<img src="img/test-retest-clipboard.png" width="30%"/>
]

---

# Parallel Forms Reliability

.content-box-gray[
**Parallel Forms Reliability**: Measured as the correlation $r_{xy}$ between scores for the same individuals on Form A and Form B
]

--

- Example: Measuring your ability to calculate standard deviations on two different days

  - We would use .secondary[two different forms] because giving you identical problems would be trivial

**.black[Issues with this scale]**

- This scale has .secondary[anxiety] and .red[depression] items

# Internal Consistency

.content-box-gray[
**Internal consistency**: Used to determine whether the items on a test (or scale) are consistent with each other, typically measured with Cronbach's $\alpha$
]

- The more consistently individual items vary with the total score on the test, the higher the value of Cronbach's $\alpha$

- Higher values means more internal consistency
