# The Basics

**Statistics**: A set of tools and techniques that are used for describing, organizing, and interpreting information or data

# The Basics

Two types of statistics

--

.content-box-gray[
**Descriptive Statistics**: Used to organize or describe the characteristics of a dataset
]

--

.content-box-gray[
**Inferential Statistics**: Used to make inferences (reach a conclusion) about the data
]

---

# The Basics

Collecting samples of data

.content-box-gray[
**Sample**: a subset of a population
]

--

- Example: A researcher wants to know if people higher on emotional intelligence are better lie detectors.

]

---

# The Basics

Populations are usually huge

- Samples are smaller, so we can start there (e.g., DU students) and extrapolate using inferential statistics

### Conducting a Study in Psychology

Tell me the following:

1. Your current happiness level (on a scale of 1 to 10)

2. Whether you have 2 or more pets (yes/no)

3. How many pets you have (e.g., 0, 1, 2)

Do people with two or more pets differ in their happiness levels compared to those with one or no pets?

### Conducting a Study in Psychology

Question #1: What’s the population? 

Question #2: What’s my sample?

# Demo

### Conducting a Study in Psychology

Step 1: Descriptive statistics to make sense of the numbers in my dataset

--

Step 2: Inferential statistics to make conclusions about the population

--

- Without both descriptive _and_ inferential statistics, the responses in my dataset would be uninterpretable (I could not make any conclusions)

---

# Statistics in Psychology

### Statistics is important for _producing_ science

- Without statistics, we would not be able to evaluate hypotheses and make conclusions about the world (e.g., about how people think, behave, and so on)

--

- Statistics allows you to determine whether differences and relationships are real and meaningful, or are due to random chance

--

- If you pursue a PhD (even a clinical one), you’ll be doing lots of research and using statistics every day!

---

# Statistics in Psychology

### Statistics is important for _consuming_ science

.pull-left[

- Statistics pop up everywhere in everyday life; understanding statistics gives you the ability to evaluate the claims that are presented to you

- If you pursue a Master’s Degree in Psychology, you’ll need to read and understand research articles!
