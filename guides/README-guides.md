# README: Guides

The _Guides_ were made using `RMarkdown` and formatted with a `latex` file (i.e., `.tex`). Specifically, you will see in the `YAML` header at the top of each `.Rmd` file for each guide, a reference to a corresponding `.tex` file. They were then compiled in with the `knitr` function in `r` to `.pdf` format. Make sure the the `.Rmd` and `.tex` file for each guide is in the same folder before compiling to a new a `.pdf` file.
