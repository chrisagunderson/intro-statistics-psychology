# Introduction to Statistics

Course I taught as instructor of record in the Department of Psychology while a PhD candidate. 

The course was created in RStudio, using `RMarkdown`, `xaringan`, and `xaringanthemer`. For mathematical formulas, LaTeX was used (e.g., see [Review Packets](https://github.com/chrisagunderson/intro-statistics-psychology/tree/master/review-packets)).

For an overview of the course content, please see the [syllabus](https://github.com/chrisagunderson/intro-statistics-psychology/blob/master/syllabus/psyc-2300-intro-stats-syllabus.pdf).
